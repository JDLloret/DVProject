ðŸ§¬ Transcriptomic Analysis of Flor Yeast Strains in Sherry Wine Production
Project Overview

This project aims to investigate potential genetic differences between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae (flor) yeast strains used in the production of 
two different classes of sherry wines (Wine A and Wine B). The objective is to determine whether the observed differences in flavor, alcohol content, 
and color are attributable to yeast strain-specific transcriptomic profiles or other biochemical processes during velum formation.

Using RNA-seq data collected across six velum development stages and four biological replicates, this study applies dimension reduction techniques 
to assess variation in gene expression between yeast strains.
